This dir contains a collection of helpers I have used when changing my github username. In particular, I created a github org with my old name, forked all my repos there, automatically adding disclaimers to the readme about the location moving. That way, a malicious user cannot create an account with my old name and inject malicious code into locations like the old url for my nvim plugin, which some people might still be using.
